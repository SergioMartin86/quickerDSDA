QuickerDSDA is an attempt at improving the performance and reduce the save state memory footprint of [DSDA-Doom](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom). The main aim is to improve the performance of headless re-recording for TASing and botting (See: [JaffarPlus](https://github.com/SergioMartin86/jaffarPlus)) purposes.
